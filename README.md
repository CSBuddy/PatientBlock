About Project:
An electronic health record (EHR) contains patient health information, such as:
Administrative and billing data
Patient demographics
Progress notes
Vital signs
Medical histories
Diagnoses
Medications
Immunization dates
Allergies
Radiology images
Lab and test results

An EHR is more than just a computerized version of a paper chart in a provider’s office. It’s a digital record that can provide comprehensive health information about your patients. EHR systems are built to share information with other health care providers and organizations – such as laboratories, specialists, medical imaging facilities, pharmacies, emergency facilities, and school and workplace clinics – so they contain information from all clinicians involved in a patient’s care.
